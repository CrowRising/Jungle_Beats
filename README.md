# Jungle_Beats

## This is my first solo project and the first time working with linked lists.
1. In this repo there will be three class Objects each with their own test file.
2. They all interact with one another, but similar to one another they follow a chain of command. 
(so to speak)
3. The end result is creating a linked list of sounds that we will be able to play from our terminal.

### Classes
1. Node
2. Linked List
3. Jungle Beat
